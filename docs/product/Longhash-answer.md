Textverse is a Text Metaverses Engine for Web3.

## Why?

We need **a prototype of Metaverse** to exploring by ourselves .

We all try to define the Metaverse, and many organizations or DAOs try to build or describe the story they believing, about the Meme and the Metaverse or Web3.

But we must across the CG/CV tech barriers, hardware costs and long terms developments. And you will only get a Metaverse by Meta, which will  controlled by a giant on  your Web2 world, would control your Web3, Metaverse future.

We want to exploring the Metaverse by ourselves in some other ways, like Textverse.

We want to talk our stories and communicate each other with the community culture, like a small world or garden we build hands on.

We **solve the problems**: High cost, many barriers and complex to access to the monopoly Metaverse plantform, replaced with **Build a Prototype Metaverse to accelerate the Exploration of the Metaverse.**

## How?

We will build on the Mud game core engine, which was a minority type game  that just typing words to interact with each other over the world.

Also, with Web3 tech, Nodejs/Ethers.js, IFPS with NFT.storage to save your assets and cards. We need some traditional Web2 tech, Docker, Faas(Firebase or Morails), etc.

The main stream of Metaverse are building the glory animations and beautiful images, sold the land to buyers and published their tokens.

But what it the basic means of Metaverse? It is a place to explore something different, something that would be huge cost to test in real would. NOT ANOTHER VIDEO GAME!

So we build the Text Engine for Metaverse, named Textverse.

#### **Low cost, No barrier, Fast access for Everyone to jump into the Metaverse.**

## What?

As prior said, we using IFPS, the Protocol labs make it, a great product, to save the interactions of the Textverse. Store the NFT assets of the Players, and we  submitting a EIP protocol to Ethereum council, to make a Transport Protocol for all the communities Metaverse.

For example, you mint your TID NFT and save to Blockchain, but your activities in the Metaverse, your different clothes, your exploring record, they are changing over the time, we will save and load it from IFPS, not Onchain, it will be fast, safe and low cost comparing with on chain.

One community, one Metaverse, and you can transfer from outside and transport between any Textverse with your meta data, your records, be save and load from IFPS with permanent time.
